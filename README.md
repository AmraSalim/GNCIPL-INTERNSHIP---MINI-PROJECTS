# GNCIPL-INTERNSHIP Projects
This repository showcases the five mini projects I developed during my 5-week internship at GNCIPL. Each project was designed to strengthen my practical skills in data analysis, machine learning, Python programming, and problem-solving. This covers a range of concepts from EDA and visualization to model building and evaluation


## Week 1 – Data Sourcing & Loading

In Week 1, learned the fundamentals of sourcing datasets from reliable platforms such as Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, and other open data portals. The focus was on understanding data formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, etc.) and learning how to load them efficiently into Python using libraries like pandas and NumPy. This week laid the foundation building skills in data acquisition and initial exploration.


## Week 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In Week 2, the focus was on performing Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the structure, patterns, and relationships within datasets. I learned how to summarize key statistics, detect missing values, identify outliers, and visualize data using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. This step was crucial for preparing data for further analysis and building a solid foundation for modeling.


## Week 3 & Week 4 – Model Building, Tuning, and Evaluation

During Weeks 3 and 4, the focus shifted to machine learning model development and optimization. I implemented clustering algorithms such as K-Means, Bisecting K-Means, and Agglomerative Clustering, followed by fine-tuning parameters to achieve better performance.

Key evaluation metrics like the Silhouette Score were used to measure cluster quality, helping in the selection of the most effective model configuration. These weeks enhanced my understanding of balancing accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability in unsupervised learning.
